## Description
I wanted to create a simple chatbot so my kids could be judged by a soulless digital elf and be reduced to objects in one of two arrays, "Naughty" or "Nice". This project is a fun way for me to work on my vanilla JavaScript abilities while including my kids. So far, I have learned about basic bot logic and reviewed DOM manipulation.
